* Use Color OLED from Adafruit
* Use horizonal scroll using 2 buttons
* Use 2 more buttons for menu activation/scrolling and for menu selection
* Should have power down menu for safety
* Should have pinmux menu for peripheral activation/deactivation
* Implementation in PRU, no more kernel module hack <= could this be possible?
