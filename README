NXCTRL - BeagleBone Black Control Library
==========

I created this library because I do want to learn how to use
mmap and /dev/mem for controlling BBB pins and subsystems. So
there might be tons of bugs and non-recommented way of modifying
system. Use with caution.

NOTE that if you're using linux kernel 3.13.x like me you have
to unload or block default tscadc driver, otherwise, this code
will surely create stack trace of kernel.

For kernel 3.13.x and 3.14.x (which is I'm using now), you might 
need to modify default am335x-boneblack.dts file as included one. 
Main differences from default one is that I have removed pwm_test
related pin configuration for this library supposed to do it
without help of device tree (by directly modifying registers).

For 3.14.x kernel(currently 3.14.0 in arch linux), pruss cannot
be access by prussdrv.
